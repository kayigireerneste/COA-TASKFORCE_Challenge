# Project Overview

This GitHub repository contains three distinct projects:

```1. Interactive Photo Gallery:``` A dynamic and visually appealing photo gallery that showcases a collection of images with detailed overlays.

```2. Coding Challenge 1:``` Array Manipulation: A solution to a coding challenge that checks for the existence of a contiguous subarray with a given sum.

```3. Coding Challenge 2:``` String Transformation: A solution to a coding challenge that transforms a string based on specific divisibility rules.


# 1. Interactive Photo Gallery

## Description
The interactive photo gallery dynamically generates photo cards with an overlay that reveals more details upon hovering. The image zooms in with a grayscale effect when hovered.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash```
   
    git clone git@github.com:kayigireerneste/COA-TASKFORCE_Challenge.git

2. open project named ```COA-TASKFORCE_Challenge``` in vs-code  software dev tool
if you don't know vs-code read more about and download it here https://code.visualstudio.com/, 

3. Open index.html in your preferred web browser to view the gallery.

## 2. Coding Challenge 1: Array Manipulation

```Problem Statement```

Given an array of integers and a target sum, determine if there exists a contiguous subarray within the array that sums up to the target. Return true if such a subarray exists, otherwise return false.

## Setup Instructions
you can view the test answers in console of your prefered browser after opening Open 
index.html of Interactive Photo Gallery in that browser.

## 3. Coding Challenge 2: String Transformation

```Problem Statement```

Given a string, transform it based on the following rules:

If the length of the string is divisible by 3, reverse the entire string.
If the length of the string is divisible by 5, replace each character with its ASCII code.
If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 15), perform both operations in the order specified above.

## Setup Instructions
you can view the test answers in console of your prefered browser after opening Open 
index.html of Interactive Photo Gallery in that browser.

## conclusion

to be able to view both projects without checking and cloning the projects code 
you can use the deployed version link as well as I have deployed it on github deploymeny service, and remember to view the test for both challenges remember to open the console of the browser
